# HELLO WORLD! :)

I am **Harshita Upadhyay**, I'm an undergraduate student at International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad. I am a big tech-enthusiast. I love working on projects which tackle real world problems. I like everything from Machine learning to system programming. I am a dance fan too. Some technologies I enjoy working with include Python, HTML, Javascript and C++.

* **I’m currently working on:** An Instagram Bot using python, A complete functional shell in C and make this readme look better.
*  **I’m currently learning:** Data Structures and algorithms fundamentals to improve competitive programming skills.
*  **Ask me about:** Please don't ask me anything. I am already fed up of my college asking me random questions in assignments.
*  **How to reach me:** Drop a mail at harshita.upadhyay@students.iiit.ac.in
*  **Pronouns:** she/her
*  **Fun fact:** It’s said that 1 year equals 7 dog years. Computers age at about the same rate. A 10 year old computer functions about as well as a 70 year old human. If this is true, no wonder those ancient computers are called “dinosaurs”.
