# HELLO WORLD! :)

I am Harshita Updhyay, and I'm an undergraduate student at IIIT-H. I am a big tech-enthusiast. I love working on projects which tackle real world problems. I like everything from Machine learning to system programming. I am a dance fan too. Some technologies I enjoy working with include Python, HTML, Javascript and C++.
